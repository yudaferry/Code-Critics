# Product Context: Code Critics

## 1. The Problem
For a solo developer, getting a second pair of eyes on code is challenging. Without the back-and-forth of a team code review, it's easy to miss small bugs, overlook best practices, or write code that's hard to maintain. This slows down personal growth and can lead to lower-quality personal projects.

## 2. The Solution
Code Critics acts as a personal AI code review partner. By integrating directly with GitHub, it brings the power of advanced AI models to the development workflow. When a developer opens a pull request, the tool automatically scans the changes and provides feedback, just like a human reviewer would.

## 3. User Experience
The experience should be seamless and non-intrusive.
- A pull request is created.
- Within a minute, review comments from "Code Critics" start appearing on the relevant lines of code.
- Alternatively, the developer can summon the reviewer at any time by commenting `@codecritics` on the pull request.
- The feedback is constructive, clear, and focused on critical bugs and security vulnerabilities.
- A summary comment is posted on the PR with an overview of the feedback.
- The developer can interact with the comments, make changes, and push updates.
- The process feels like having an experienced, always-available collaborator.
