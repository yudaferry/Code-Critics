## Project Phases & Tasks

### üü© Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation (Complete)
- [x] Initialize project with TypeScript and Git
- [x] Establish and refine the Memory Bank documentation structure
- [x] Create a reproducible development environment using `shell.nix`
- [x] Resolve dependency installation issues by migrating from `pnpm` to `yarn`
- [x] Successfully install all dependencies using `yarn`
- [x] Set up environment variables (.env file for GITHUB_TOKEN, AI_API_KEY)

### üü® Phase 2: GitHub Integration (Ready to Start)
- [ ] Create the basic directory structure inside `/src`
- [ ] Set up a basic Express server to act as the webhook entry point
- [ ] Implement the Octokit client for GitHub API communication
- [ ] Implement webhook signature verification for security
- [ ] Handle `pull_request` and `issue_comment` events
- [ ] Test basic GitHub API connectivity

### ‚¨úÔ∏è Phase 3: Core AI Review Logic (Not Started)
- [ ] Design and implement a configurable AI client for Gemini and DeepSeek
- [ ] Develop and refine a system prompt focused on critical bugs and security
- [ ] Implement logic to fetch PR diffs and interact with the AI API
- [ ] Create the review engine to post inline and summary comments to GitHub
- [ ] Function to parse AI response and integrate feedback
- [ ] Implement review status reporting (pending, success, failure)

### ‚¨úÔ∏è Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (Not Started)
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for core logic and API interactions
- [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- [ ] Deploy the application to Vercel
- [ ] Monitor and optimize performance

### ‚¨úÔ∏è Phase 5: Advanced Features & Maintenance (Not Started)
- [ ] Implement per-repository configuration
- [ ] Set up logging and monitoring for the deployed service
- [ ] Plan and implement rate limit handling strategies
- [ ] Add configurable review rules to guide AI
- [ ] Allow switching between different AI models via configuration
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation and user guides

## What Works
- **Project Foundation**: Complete memory bank documentation structure established
- **Architecture Design**: Clear system patterns and component relationships defined
- **Technical Stack**: Node.js + TypeScript + GitHub API + AI integration approach confirmed
- **Development Plan**: Phased approach with clear milestones and success metrics
- **Project Structure**: Node.js project initialized with TypeScript configuration

## Current Status
- **Overall Progress**: 20% (Foundation complete, ready to start Phase 2)
- **Current Phase**: Phase 2 (GitHub Integration) - Ready to Start
- **Next Milestone**: Create basic webhook server and GitHub API client
- **Blockers**: None

## Known Issues
- None at this stage - project is in planning/setup phase

## Evolution of Decisions
- **AI-First Approach**: Shifted from traditional static analysis to AI-powered review
- **Configurable AI Backend**: Support for both Gemini (default) and DeepSeek
- **Webhook Architecture**: Event-driven design for real-time PR analysis
- **Personal Use Focus**: Optimized for individual developer workflow
