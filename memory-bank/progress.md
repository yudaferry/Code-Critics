# Progress: Code Critics

This document tracks the high-level progress of the project through its key development phases.

## Current Status: ðŸŸ¨ Phase 1 (95% Complete)
- **Phase 1: Project Setup**
  - [x] Initialize Node.js project with TypeScript
  - [x] Configure TypeScript compilation
  - [x] Create project structure
  - [x] Establish and refine Memory Bank documentation
  - [x] Configure Node.js 22 + pnpm environment
  - [x] Set up all configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, vercel.json)
  - [x] Create environment files (.env, .env.example)
  - [x] Configure security (.gitignore)
  - [x] Add all required dependencies (AI clients, GitHub API, HTTP client)
  - [ ] Install dependencies (`pnpm install`)
  - [ ] Update .env with actual GitHub Personal Access Token

## Upcoming Phases
- **Phase 2: GitHub Integration**
  - [ ] Set up GitHub API client with Octokit
  - [ ] Implement authentication
  - [ ] Create webhook endpoint to handle `pull_request` and `issue_comment` events
  - [ ] Implement webhook signature verification

- **Phase 3: Core AI Review Logic**
  - [ ] Design and implement a configurable AI client for Gemini and DeepSeek
  - [ ] Develop and refine prompt to focus on critical bugs and security
  - [ ] Implement logic to fetch PR diffs and interact with the AI API
  - [ ] Create the review engine to post inline and summary comments

- **Phase 4: Testing & Deployment**
  - [ ] Write unit and integration tests
  - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for Vercel
  - [ ] Deploy to production

- **Phase 5: Advanced Features & Maintenance**
  - [ ] Implement per-repository configuration
  - [ ] Set up logging and monitoring
  - [ ] Plan for rate limit handling

## What Works
- **Project Foundation**: Complete memory bank documentation structure established
- **Architecture Design**: Clear system patterns and component relationships defined
- **Technical Stack**: Node.js + TypeScript + GitHub API + AI integration approach confirmed
- **Development Plan**: Phased approach with clear milestones and success metrics
- **Project Structure**: Node.js project initialized with TypeScript configuration

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1 (Current): Project Setup
- [ ] Install dependencies (`pnpm install`)
- [ ] Set up environment variables (.env file for GITHUB_TOKEN, AI_API_KEY)

### Phase 2: GitHub Integration
- [ ] Set up GitHub API client with Octokit
- [ ] Implement authentication with Personal Access Token
- [ ] Test basic GitHub API connectivity
- [ ] Create webhook endpoint for GitHub events
- [ ] Implement webhook signature verification
- [ ] Handle pull request events
- [ ] Handle issue comment events (for `@codecritics` trigger)

### Phase 3: Core AI Review Logic
- [ ] Design AI interaction framework with a configurable client (Gemini/DeepSeek)
- [ ] Develop initial prompt focused on finding critical bugs and security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Implement AI API client (for Gemini/DeepSeek)
- [ ] Function to fetch and prepare entire PR diff for the AI
- [ ] Function to parse AI response
- [ ] Integrate AI feedback into review comment system
- [ ] Implement review status reporting (pending, success, failure)

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Add configurable review rules to guide AI
- [ ] Allow switching between different AI models (Gemini/DeepSeek) via configuration
- [ ] Create review summary reports from AI feedback
- [ ] Add ignore patterns and exceptions

### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Write unit tests for core functions
- [ ] Write integration tests for GitHub API
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Deploy to production environment
- [ ] Monitor and optimize performance

### Phase 6: Documentation & Maintenance
- [ ] Write comprehensive README
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Set up logging and monitoring
- [ ] Plan for rate limit handling
- [ ] Create user configuration guide

## Current Status
- **Overall Progress**: 15% (Foundation, planning, and project structure complete)
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 (Project Setup)
- **Next Milestone**: Complete environment setup and dependency installation
- **Blockers**: None

## Known Issues
- None at this stage - project is in planning/setup phase

## Evolution of Decisions
- **AI-First Approach**: Shifted from traditional static analysis to AI-powered review
- **Configurable AI Backend**: Support for both Gemini (default) and DeepSeek
- **Webhook Architecture**: Event-driven design for real-time PR analysis
- **Personal Use Focus**: Optimized for individual developer workflow
