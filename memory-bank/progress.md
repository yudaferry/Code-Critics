## Project Phases & Tasks

### üü© Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation (Complete)
- [x] Initialize project with TypeScript and Git
- [x] Establish and refine the Memory Bank documentation structure
- [x] Create a reproducible development environment using `shell.nix`
- [x] Resolve dependency installation issues by migrating from `pnpm` to `yarn`
- [x] Successfully install all dependencies using `yarn`
- [x] Set up environment variables (.env file for GITHUB_TOKEN, AI_API_KEY)

### üü® Phase 2: GitHub Integration (In Progress)
- [x] 2.1 Create the basic directory structure inside `/src`
- [x] 2.2 Set up a basic Express server to act as the webhook entry point
- [x] 2.3 Implement the Octokit client for GitHub API communication
- [x] 2.4 Implement webhook signature verification for security
- [x] 2.5 Handle `pull_request` and `issue_comment` events
- [ ] 2.6 Test basic GitHub API connectivity

### ‚¨úÔ∏è Phase 3: Core AI Review Logic (Not Started)
- [ ] 3.1 Design and implement a configurable AI client for Gemini and DeepSeek
- [ ] 3.2 Develop and refine a system prompt focused on critical bugs and security
- [ ] 3.3 Implement logic to fetch PR diffs and interact with the AI API
- [ ] 3.4 Create the review engine to post inline and summary comments to GitHub
- [ ] 3.5 Function to parse AI response and integrate feedback
- [ ] 3.6 Implement review status reporting (pending, success, failure)

### ‚¨úÔ∏è Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (Not Started)
- [ ] 4.1 Write unit and integration tests for core logic and API interactions
- [ ] 4.2 Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- [ ] 4.3 Deploy the application to Vercel
- [ ] 4.4 Monitor and optimize performance

### ‚¨úÔ∏è Phase 5: Advanced Features & Maintenance (Not Started)
- [ ] 5.1 Implement per-repository configuration
- [ ] 5.2 Set up logging and monitoring for the deployed service
- [ ] 5.3 Plan and implement rate limit handling strategies
- [ ] 5.4 Add configurable review rules to guide AI
- [ ] 5.5 Allow switching between different AI models via configuration
- [ ] 5.6 Create comprehensive documentation and user guides

## What Works
- **Project Foundation**: Complete memory bank documentation structure established
- **Architecture Design**: Clear system patterns and component relationships defined
- **Technical Stack**: Node.js + TypeScript + GitHub API + AI integration approach confirmed
- **Development Plan**: Phased approach with clear milestones and success metrics
- **Project Structure**: Node.js project initialized with TypeScript configuration
- **Enhanced Server**: Express.js server with comprehensive health check and error handling
- **Dependencies**: All required packages installed (Express, Octokit, AI clients, dev tools)
- **GitHub Integration**: Complete Octokit client with authentication, rate limiting, and error handling
- **Webhook Security**: HMAC-SHA256 signature verification and payload validation
- **Event Handling**: Full support for pull_request and issue_comment events with rate limiting
- **Repository Security**: Allowlist support and per-repository rate limiting
- **Structured Logging**: Comprehensive logging with context and error tracking

## Current Status
- **Overall Progress**: 40% (Foundation complete, Phase 2 nearly complete)
- **Current Phase**: Phase 2 (GitHub Integration) - In Progress (5/6 tasks complete)
- **Next Milestone**: Test basic GitHub API connectivity (Task 2.6)
- **Blockers**: None

## Known Issues
- None at this stage - project is in planning/setup phase

## Evolution of Decisions
- **AI-First Approach**: Shifted from traditional static analysis to AI-powered review
- **Configurable AI Backend**: Support for both Gemini (default) and DeepSeek
- **Webhook Architecture**: Event-driven design for real-time PR analysis
- **Personal Use Focus**: Optimized for individual developer workflow
- **TypeScript Upgrade**: Updated from TypeScript 4.9.5 to 5.8.3 for better editor support and modern features
- **Editor Integration**: Implemented Yarn SDK for VS Code/Cursor to resolve dependency resolution issues
