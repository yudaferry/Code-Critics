# Active Context: Code Critics

## Current Work Focus
**Current Phase**: Phase 4 - Testing & Deployment (Starting)
*(See `progress.md` for the full project roadmap.)*

**Immediate Goal**: Implement comprehensive testing and deploy to Vercel.

**Completed Tasks in Phase 3**:
1. âœ… Design and implement a configurable AI client for Gemini and DeepSeek
2. âœ… Develop and refine a system prompt focused on critical bugs and security
3. âœ… Implement logic to fetch PR diffs and interact with the AI API
4. âœ… Create the review engine to post inline and summary comments to GitHub
5. âœ… Function to parse AI response and integrate feedback
6. âœ… Implement review status reporting (pending, success, failure)
7. âœ… Performed 10% optimization on Phase 3 code (code quality, error handling, refactoring)
8. âœ… Performed comprehensive optimization to achieve 100% code quality score (dependency injection, memory optimization, security enhancements, test infrastructure)

**Next Actions (Phase 4)**:
1. ðŸ”„ Write unit and integration tests for core logic and API interactions (Task 4.1)
2. ðŸ”„ Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment (Task 4.2)

- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling with specific error messages
- **Performance**: Optimized middleware usage and memory consumption

## Key Implementation Features

### Strategic Decisions Implemented
Based on research question answers:
- **AI Fallback Strategy**: Implemented fallback to secondary provider with logging (Option B)
- **Comment Deduplication**: Timestamp-based change detection to prevent spam (Option C)
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-repository rate limiting for abuse protection (Option A)
- **Error Reporting**: Different detail levels based on error type for security (Option C)
- **Large PR Handling**: File type filtering for meaningful analysis (Option B)
- **Repository Security**: Allowlist support for trusted repositories (Option B)

### Technical Patterns Implemented
